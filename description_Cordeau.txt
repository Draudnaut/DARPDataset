data format:
    (vehicle number) (vertex count) (maximum distance for vehicle) (capacity) (ridetime)
    vertex information:
    (index number of vertex) (x coordinate) (y coordinate) (service time) (quality of goods to be transfer) (time window start) (time window end)
input data description:
    one data file has only one set of data wait to be input.
    The first line contains five integers which present the number of vehicle , total number of pickup vertex and delivery vertex,maximum distance for vehicle,capacity of the vehicle,and the ridetime respectivly.
    Following lines contains the vertex information.
    On the each line,there are 7 integers represents the index number of the vertex,x coordinate,y coordinate,service time,quality of goods to be transfer,time window start,time window end.
